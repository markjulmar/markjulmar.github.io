Sales of the TSP++ products have steadily fallen over the past 5 years, so much so that I decided two years ago to release the 2.x product into the open-source community, and now I am doing the same for the server edition.

The source code has all been released under the MIT license and is available [here](https://github.com/markjulmar/tsplib3). Documentation and samples are all in the GitHub repo so have fun!
