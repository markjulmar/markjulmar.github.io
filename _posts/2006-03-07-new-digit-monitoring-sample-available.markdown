Matthias Moetje (Tapi MVP) has graciously taken one of the VB6 Platform SDK samples and ported it to the [ITapi3 library](https://github.com/markjulmar/itapi3) and allowed me to distribute it in the [Tapi3 Samples](https://github.com/markjulmar/itapi3/tree/master/samples). It allows you to select an address, place a call on it and then monitor or generate digits.  Great sample - thanks Matthias!

Check it out [here](https://github.com/markjulmar/itapi3/tree/master/samples/DtmfTest).
