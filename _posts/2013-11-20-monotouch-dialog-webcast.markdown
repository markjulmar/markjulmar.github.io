I did a webcast last week on using [Monotouch.Dialog](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/MonoTouch.Dialog) to build data-driven iOS applications with Xamarin.iOS. Thanks to all who attended - if you missed it, you can watch it here:

[Building Data Driven applications with Monotouch.Dialog](http://www.develop.com/webcasts/watch/526017dcd588bf08f82ac930/building-data-driven-applications-for-ios-in-csharp)

and the sample applications are here:

Enjoy!
