I've really gotten into using code snippets and the compiler expansions in VSNET 2005 -- it cuts my typing way down and I love it.  I've always thought it odd that VB.NET had a ton more snippets pre-installed than C# (my language of choice).  But Microsoft has rectified that with the release of C# snippets on MSDN ([http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/codesnippets/default.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165392.aspx)) which includes most, if not all the VB.NET ones but recoded for C#.

Now, the hard part will be knowing what's there!
