Hi there. I'm Mark Smith and this is my personal blogging space. This is mostly an archive of a blog that I ran on **julmar.com** for several years while I  was an instructor and consultant for DevelopMentor and Wintellect. Over my career I have worked on various platforms from mainframes (IBM/370), 16-bit Windows/DOS programs, 32-bit OS/2 and Windows apps, finally to Cloud apps. I specialized in graphics-intensive programs for Windows for various clients including Microsoft, the University of Texas, Fidelity Investments, and Mobile/Exxon. I was a Microsoft MVP for several years, and finally ended up at Xamarin where I helped to launch and build Xamarin University. That path led me to Microsoft where I now oversee the authoring, build, and publishing aspects of [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).

Any thoughts expressed on this site are mine and do not reflect the opinions or thoughts of my employer.
