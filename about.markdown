Hi there. I'm Mark Smith and this is my personal blogging space. This is mostly an archive of a blog that I ran on **julmar.com** for several years while I  was an instructor and consultant for DevelopMentor and Wintellect. These days I'm a Product Manager at Microsoft where I oversee the interactivity options you'll find on <https://docs.microsoft.com> and [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn).

In my past life I worked on 16-bit Windows/DOS programs, 32-bit OS/2 apps, wrote graphics-intensive programs including the massively popular AfterDark screensaver for Windows 3.0, and assisted a variety of big companies get their apps built and launched.

Any thoughts expressed on this site are mine and do not reflect the opinions or thoughts of my employer.
