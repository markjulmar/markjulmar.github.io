It’s been a big learning experience for me in many ways because the traditional mechanisms for dealing with things in WPF just flat out fail when we load big datasets and start scrolling them around.

<p>All that said, our current effort is now online with full source code – it’s interesting stuff to browse through even if you aren’t into molecular biology – check it out at <a href="http://rcat.codeplex.com/">http://rcat.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<p>Here’s a nice screen shot showing some of the elements – dockable tabs and sidebar items, birds-eye viewer, taxonomy viewer and custom colorization of nucleotide data.  And it, of course, is all MVVM.  Fun stuff!</p>
