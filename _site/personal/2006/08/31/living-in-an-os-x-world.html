    <p>A DM colleague of mine, <a href="http://nielsb.wordpress.com/2006/08/29/apps-for-a-windows-user-on-osx/">Neils Berglund</a> noted his required applications under OS X and asked for feedback on what everyone else is using (assuming you are on OS X anyway).</p>

<p>The original question was what RSS reader are you using.. my preference is <a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/">NetNewsWire</a> as I was used to the Newsgator line of products when using Windows all the time so it made an easy transition for me. I also use <strong>MarsEdit</strong> to update posts on this blog – it’s not WYSIWYG but it keeps my HTML skills (if I ever had any) from drying up.</p>

<p>So, adding to Neils list, I also use –</p>

<ul>
  <li>Final Cut Express - for editing movies, I found iMovie to be too limiting.</li>
  <li>CHMOX - to open and read .CHM (Windows Help) files.</li>
  <li>DivX codecs - to play my 300+ .divx movies.</li>
  <li>Smultron - a decent, quick color-coded text editor</li>
  <li>Virtue Desktops - an awesome window manager.</li>
  <li>Remote Buddy - allows the Apple Remote to be used to control other applications such as Power Point.</li>
  <li>Microsoft Office - I just can’t live without Word/Excel/Power Point. I know Apple has iWork, but it just isn’t quite the same.</li>
  <li>Flip4Mac - Codecs for .WMV (Windows Media), essential in a 99.999% Windows dominated world.</li>
  <li>Coverflow - this isn’t critical, but it’s a fun app to show off - it let’s you view your music through the album covers in a cool, flip-3d style fashion.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m also trying out a .mac membership for backup purposes. Not sure I’ll stay with that, but it is automatic and seems to work even when I travel.</p>

<p>So, what things do <strong>you</strong> think are necessary applications under OS X?</p>
